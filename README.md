# ela_nn_function_generation

* benchmarks: contains all code to run the benchmark experiments and create Critical Difference plots
    - nevergrad experiments can be run by selecting the functions in example.py and executing: "python -m nevergrad.benchmark additional_experiment --imports=example.py"
* "Parallel Plots.ipynb" creates Figure 5 from the paper
* "Model Training.ipynb" contains the code to "fit" the neural networks to the optimized point clouds
* "Contour Plotting.ipynb" creates Figure 8 from the paper
